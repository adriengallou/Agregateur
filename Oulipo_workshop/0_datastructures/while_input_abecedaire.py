This script takes a sentence you write in the terminal, and gives it back in reverse mode
A list is ordered and changeable. It is less efficient than a set/tuple. But it allows to work with index numbers.

# Run script in loop:
while True:

	# Ask to write a sentence
	sentence = input("Ecrivez votre phrase: ").lower().strip('\., \?')

	# Split sentence into words
	words = sentence.split()
	#print(words)

	# if sentence is only 1 word, reverse word
	if len(words) < 2:
		for word in words:
			word = word[::-1]
			print(word.capitalize())
	# if sentence is more than 1 word
	else:
		words.sort()
		print(" ".join(words).capitalize(), '.')
